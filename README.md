Engineer, open-sourcer, and ride-or-die TypeScripter. My friends and I build and maintain The BED Stack, a project demonstrating code standards in a bleeding edge framework. I also maintain Firebase tools like hooked-on-firebase, a React Hooks library for Firebase, and firebase-turbo-starter, a starter template for a turbo monorepo with working deployments.
