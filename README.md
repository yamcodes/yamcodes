My friends and I build and maintain (The Bed Stack)[https://agnyz.github.io/the-bed-stack/] a project demonstrating code standards in a bleeding edge framework. 
I also maintain Firebase tools like hooked-on-firebase, a React Hooks library for Firebase, and turborepo-firebase-starter, a starter template for a turbo monorepo with working deployments.
