Hi, I'm Yam!

I'm an _engineer, open sourcerer and ride-or-die TypeScripter_ <sup>(thanks [colinhacks](https://github.com/colinhacks) for this killer line 🍻)</sup>

My friends and I currently (mid 2025) build and maintain [Bedstack](https://bedstack.js.org), a real world example app built with a bleeding edge framework. 

**🔥🔥🔥 I also _love_ Firebase 🔥🔥🔥**

I maintain various Firebase tools like [hooked-on-firebase](https://github.com/yamcodes/hooked-on-firebase), a React Hooks library for Firebase, and [turborepo-firebase-starter](https://github.com/yamcodes/turborepo-firebase-starter), a starter template for a turbo monorepo with working deployments.
