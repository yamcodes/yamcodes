My friends and I build and maintain [The Bed Stack](https://agnyz.github.io/the-bed-stack/), a project demonstrating code standards in a bleeding edge framework. 
I also maintain Firebase tools like [hooked-on-firebase](https://github.com/yamcodes/hooked-on-firebase), a React Hooks library for Firebase, and [turborepo-firebase-starter](https://github.com/yamcodes/turborepo-firebase-starter), a starter template for a turbo monorepo with working deployments.
