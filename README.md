Hi, I'm Yam!

What I am can be summarized by the following [colinhacks](https://github.com/colinhacks) (Zod/tRPC creator) quote:

My friends and I build and maintain [Bedstack](https://agnyz.github.io/bedstack), a real world example for an app built with a bleeding edge framework. 

**ðŸ”¥ I also LOVE Firebase ðŸ”¥**

I maintain various Firebase tools like [hooked-on-firebase](https://github.com/yamcodes/hooked-on-firebase), a React Hooks library for Firebase, and [turborepo-firebase-starter](https://github.com/yamcodes/turborepo-firebase-starter), a starter template for a turbo monorepo with working deployments.
